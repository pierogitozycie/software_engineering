# Software Engineering Projects

This repository contains various projects developed during Software Engineering classes. Each folder demonstrates the implementation of specific design patterns and principles. Below is an overview of the folder structure and its contents.

## Folder Structure

### `command_pattern`
This folder contains an implementation of the Command Pattern. It demonstrates encapsulating requests as objects, allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests, as well as support for undoable operations.

### `observer_pattern`
This folder includes an implementation of the Observer Pattern. It showcases how to define a one-to-many dependency between objects, ensuring that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified automatically.
